The program use fgets to read a username and compare it with "dat_wil"

then it use fgets again to read a password but this time the read input length is greater than the buffer
therefore there is a possible stack overflow

we can use it to perform a return-to-libc

so we prepare the payload with the username then dummy bytes to overflow the buffer
then the libc's system's address, a dummy return address, and finally the string "/bin/sh"
