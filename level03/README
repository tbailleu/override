The program use scanf to read a password

Here it's a crypto challenge but with only 15 case we can do a easy bruteforce

the password is substract from a constant 322424845

and then after some condition, it's use as a mask for a decryption algorithm

after the switch case we see that the mask can be either
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 or 21

we just need to test them
we send 322424845 minus the value we want

level03@OverRide:~$> (python -c 'print 322424845 - 18'; cat) | ./level03

level04@OverRide:~$> cat ~level04/.pass
