After disassembling the executable and testing its behavior,
we can see that the program makes a backup of the file passed as an argument into a folder named backups

We therefore need to pass as an argument the path of the file that contains the password of the level09
on which we do not currently have read rights to, in order to make a copy that we can access
However, we do not have write permission in the home directory for the backup to take place

We notice that the program uses a relative path for the backup destination
if we run the program from /tmp, then we will have write permissions and thus be able to create the corresponding folders and subfolders

level08@OverRide:~$> cd /tmp
level08@OverRide:/tmp$> mkdir -p ./backups/home/users/level09

level08@OverRide:/tmp$> ~/level08 /home/users/level09/.pass

level08@OverRide:/tmp$> cat ./backups/home/users/level09/.pass
